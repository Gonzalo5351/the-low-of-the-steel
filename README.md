# The Law of Steel ðŸ”¥

A command-line app written in Python to track 7 days of physical and mental discipline.

**7 days to forge the soul in steel.**

## What does it do?

Every day, it asks if you:

- Woke up at the planned time
- Completed your bodyweight workout
- Ate clean (chicken, rice, eggs)
- Want to leave a note (motivation or self-insults welcome)

## Why?

Because self-discipline is worth more than a thousand likes.  
Because if you donâ€™t track your progress, youâ€™re living in the illusion of effort.  
Because no oneâ€™s coming to save you.

## How to use it

```bash
python src/main.py

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt ```
